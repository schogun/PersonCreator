PersonCreator
=============

Just a little project to show what we can do with Spring MVC.

The following technics were used:
Java 1.7, Maven (project), Spring MVC (with controller, manager and views), JPA, ObjectDB, Bootstrap, Jquery, Json via Gson.

Preferable run on Tomcat 7 in eclipse.

Artefact id is person, so to run on local server use
e.g. http://localhost:8080/person
